# Get your transactions from the Up! Banking API

Up! is a digital bank in Australia much loved by its user base and focussed on a modern, mobile-first banking experience. Up! have recently made their [API (beta)](https://developer.up.com.au/#welcome) available for personal use.

This class allows you to extract all `account`, `transaction` and `category` data from the API. To use the utility you'll need to get your own `ApiKey` from [the developer portal](https://api.up.com.au/getting_started). Update the `"UPBANKING_API_KEY"` value in the `configurationDict` variable.

This is useful because you can't yet export your transactions in bulk through the app :man_facepalming:.

Once you get programmatic access to your transactions... well this is where the magic begins :boom: :tada:... enjoy!
